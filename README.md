## Using Google Calendar to Manage Library Website Hours

This is the code from Andrew Darby's article from the 
*[Code4Lib Journal](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/46)*
published in 2008.

1. I want to make the MySQL queries more secure.  
2. The existing code does not have a way to handle instances when the library is open 24 hours.
